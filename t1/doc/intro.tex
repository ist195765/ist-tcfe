The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing a
sinusoidal voltage source $V_I$ connected to a resistor $R$ and a capacitor $C$
in series. The circuit can be seen if.


In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing dependent and idependent of voltage and current sources alonside various resistors. To do so we've obtained the current in the various meshes and the voltage in all the nodes.
