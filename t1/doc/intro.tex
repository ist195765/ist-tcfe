% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing dependent and idependent of voltage and current sources alonside various resistors. To do so we've obtained the current in the various meshes and the voltage in all the nodes.

In Section 2, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is presented. In Section 5, the circuit is
analysed by simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section 2. The conclusions of this study are outlined in Section 6.
