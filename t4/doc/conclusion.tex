\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the goal especified in the introduction has been achieved with a great merit.\\
All analyses have been performed both theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the
Ngspice tool. When comparing these last two we conclude that there aren't any disparity between the results and therefore no errors associated.
So, we conclude that the architeture that we used can be validated.
