\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing the circuit especified in the introduction has been
achieved. All analyses have been performed both theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the
Ngspice tool. When comparing these last two we conclude that there aren't any disparity between the results and therefore no errors associated.\\
So we conclude that the methods utilized to analyse the circuit in question can be validated.
