% state the learning objective 

In this laboratory assignment we accomplish various objectives,
In first place we analyse the circuit when t<0, using the nodal method to determine the voltages in all nodes and currents in all branches.(fig1) Then, in order to find the $R_eq$, we change the circuit into what in the fig2 is displaying and work with that circuit to
find the solution to , and to finalise
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing dependent and independent sources of both voltage and current alonside various resistors (2 dependent sources, 2 independent souces and 7 resistors to be more precise). To do so we've obtained the current in the various meshes and the voltage in all the nodes, using two diferent methods alongside a simlulation to corroborate the results.
The circuit that will be analysed is represented in the image below and the values of each constant are especifed in the table below.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}. \\
