% state the learning objective 

In this laboratory assignment we study a circuit containing various elements, amongst them a capacitor, resistances and dependent and independent sources of voltage and current in order to accomplish various objectives. At first we analyse the circuit when t<0, using the nodal method to determine the voltages in all nodes and currents in all branches. Then, in order to find the $R_eq$, we change the circuit into what is displayed in Figure 2, and with this new circuit, we'll find the total solution of the voltage $V_s$. To finalize, we are going to determine the frequency responses of the voltage in the capacitor and in the node 6.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}. \\
