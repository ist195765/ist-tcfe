\section{Theoretical Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

In this section we will analyse theoretical our audio amplifier circuit. \\
To do so, and because there were several things to be analysed, we divided the theoretical analysis in the following subsections that explain the different sectors that our circuit has and also each one will be detailed separately.\\

The constants values used are expressed in the following table.
